# Python

Python is powerful... and fast; plays well with others; runs everywhere; is
friendly & easy to learn; is Open.

## Jupyter

I sometimes used jupyter notebooks for my studies. It always bugged me, that the
layout does not expand to the whole space available. This config solves exactly
that.
