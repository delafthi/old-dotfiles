# Scripts

This folder contains custom scripts and executables I regularly use.

## outlook, teams, protonmail

These scripts are simple bash functions, which call the according
website/webapplications in a borderless brave window. The only dependency is
the [brave browser](https://brave.com/).

## sshot

This script is used to take and save a screen shot to the defined file. Call it
with

```sh
sshot <filename>.<fileending>
```

This script depends on
