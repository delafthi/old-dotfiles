# Alacritty

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive configuration. By integrating with other applications,
rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible
set of features with high performance. The supported platforms currently consist
of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a beta level of readiness; there are a few
missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as a daily
driver.
