# Ranger

Ranger is a terminal based file manager with vim-like keybindings. The configs
are pretty much the defaults with only some slight changes. The plan is to maybe
invest some time to customize the defauls a little bit more and add some custom
functions.

## Dependencies

Maybe some programs are set as defaults. However, ranger can handle cases where
a program is not installed.
