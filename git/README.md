# Git config

This folder contains the configuration for git. Some basic configuration of git
gui tools is also included (mostly only the font, because to configure the rest
is horrible).

- Stow ignores `.gitignore` files. Therefore, the global .gitignore list has
  to be linked manually.

## Dependencies

The only dependency is the Victor Mono Nerd Font.
