# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Git config

The configuration for git. Some basic configuration of git
gui tools is also included (mostly only the font, because to configure the rest
is horrible).

- Make sure to adjust the personal information in the `.gitconfig` file.
