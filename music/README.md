# Music

Configuration related to the music players I use.

## Spotifyd

> An open source Spotify client running as a UNIX daemon.

Spotifyd streams music just like the official client, but is more lightweight
and supports more platforms. Spotifyd also supports the Spotify Connect
protocol, which makes it show up as a device that can be controlled from the
official clients.
