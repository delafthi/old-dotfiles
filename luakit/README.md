# Luakit

Luakit is a highly configurable browser framework based on the WebKit web
content engine and the GTK+ toolkit. It is very fast, extensible with Lua, and
licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license. It is primarily targeted at power users,
developers and anyone who wants to have fine-grained control over their web
browser’s behaviour and interface.
