# Bash

This folders contains the configuration for bash. The most popular shell, which
is widely used in the industry.

## Dependencies

The only hard dependency of this configuration is `bash_completion`, which is in
my opinion a necessity for bash. The following dependency are not required.
However, I highly suggest you to install them.
