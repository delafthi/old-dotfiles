# Bash

## Dependencies


The only hard dependency of this configuration is `bash_completion`, which is in
my opinion a necessity for bash. The following dependency are not required.
However, I highly suggest you to install them.

- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (As a manpager and default editor)
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- [starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (Suggested to install over the default
  package manager)
  - [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
- [nix](https://nixos.org/) (As an alternative package manager)
