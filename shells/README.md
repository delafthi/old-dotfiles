## Bash

Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell. This is an sh-compatible
shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C
shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2
Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both
programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash
without modification.
