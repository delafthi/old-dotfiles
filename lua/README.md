# Lua

Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It
supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional
programming, data-driven programming, and data description.

## Stylua

An opinionated code formatter for Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and Luau, built using
full-moon. StyLua is inspired by the likes of [prettier](prettier.md), it parses
your Lua codebase, and prints it back out from scratch, enforcing a consistent
code style.
