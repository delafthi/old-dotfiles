# Mail

Electronic mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages ("mail")
between people using electronic devices. Email was thus conceived as the
electronic (digital) version of, or counterpart to, mail, at a time when "mail"
meant only physical mail (hence e- + mail). Email later became a ubiquitous
(very widely used) communication medium, to the point that in current use, an
email address is often treated as a basic and necessary part of many processes
in business, commerce, government, education, entertainment, and other spheres
of daily life in most countries.
