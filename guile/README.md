# Guile Scheme

Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language. Scheme
(http://schemers.org/) is an elegant and conceptually simple dialect of Lisp,
originated by Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman, and since evolved by the series of
reports known as RnRS (the Revised^n Reports on Scheme).
